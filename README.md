# ROT-Operator-Spectrum-Demonstration
Numerical demonstration of the ROT Hermitian operator spectrum and its alignment with the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Includes Python code, data outputs, and plots showing how Recursive Observation Theory (ROT) provides a constructive operator realization of the Hilbert–Pólya approach.
